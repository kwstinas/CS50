# CS50
Presented here are a selection of the labs and problem sets I successfully finished during my enrollment in the CS50 course.
CS50 is an online introductory program created by harvard, covering computer science and programming. 
The curriculum encompasses languages like C, Python, SQL, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript,
along with fundamental computer science principles such as algorithms and data structures, abstraction, encapsulation, resource management, security, and the Flask web framework.
